Hello there!  

I'm excited to introduce you to **PrestonOS**, my personal corner of the web.

After working on a variety of personal projects, including open source libraries and my OS-style portfolio, I realised I wanted a space to document things I'm working on or thinking about.

This website uses the [Fuse JSX framework](https://github.com/prestons18/fuse), which I built from scratch. It uses a custom page router, fine-grained reactivity and signals, everything that I love about building web apps in TypeScript.

If you're curious, feel free to explore the code, poke around, or reach out, I'd love to hear what you think. And of course, stay tuned for more posts, projects, and experiments coming soon!
